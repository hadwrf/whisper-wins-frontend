## Before development

* To ensure code consistency and quality, please configure your IDE to automatically format with **Prettier** and **ESLint** on save.

## Git
* Clear, **descriptive commit messages** are essential for a maintainable codebase. They help us understand why changes were made, 
make it easier to trace bugs, and improve collaboration. 
* Separate subject and body with a blank line
* Explain the **why**, not just the what.
* To maintain a clean and linear commit history, **please use rebase instead of merge** when incorporating changes from the main branch
